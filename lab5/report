How to run scripts
=========================
The scripts can just be run on command line.
I ran them as follows:

~/$ python 2.1.py > 2.1.out

~/$ python 2.2.py > 2.2.out

~/$ python product_dedup.py

~/$ python dedup_evaluation.py

Dedupe report
=========================
One set of output from dedup_evaluation.py:
Precision: 0.529220779221
Recall: 0.125384615385

I used the title, price, and manufacturer fields for detecting duplicates.
I kept the default String comparator for title and manufacturer, and
modified the custom comparator for price to consider duplicates to be within
a 20% price difference. I also converted GBP to USD for more accurate
comparisons. The trade off between precision and recall was not changed.
Depending on the training set, my solution achieves varying levels of
precision and recall. I observed 44%, 28%, and 53% precision, along with
18%, 16%, and 12.5% recall, respectively.

I would improve my solution by adding custom comparators for title and
manufacturer, perhaps using the jellyfish library's levenshtein_distance
function. I could also add the product description field and compare the
first 10 words.
