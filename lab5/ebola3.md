India is prepared to deal with any cases of Ebola, the highly infectious virus, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has said.
More than 10,000 people have contracted the Ebola virus, with 4,922 deaths, according to the World Health Organisation's latest figures.
All but 27 of the cases have occurred in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.
There are fears that the virus will spread unchecked if it arrives in India.
Mr Vardhan told BBC Hindi that thermal scanners and a "virus tracking equipment" had been installed at 18 airports and steps taken to track and isolate passengers suspected to be carrying the virus.
"We have made provisions to quarantine passengers with Ebola-like symptoms and keep them under observation for the mandatory 21 days in isolated [hospital] wards."
Mr Vardhan said trained health workers had been provided with protective gear to deal with patients.
He said India had isolated a number of people coming from countries such as Liberia and Sierra Leone at its airports and seaports.
On Saturday, an Indian woman, serving in Liberia as a UN peacekeeper, was isolated on arrival after she was found to be having "Ebola-like symptoms".
All the people isolated so far have tested negative for the disease.
